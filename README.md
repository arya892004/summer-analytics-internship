# üöó Real-Time Parking Price Prediction System using Pathway

A real-time dynamic pricing system that monitors parking lot data and computes optimal daily prices using advanced analytics and contextual information like traffic, vehicle type, and special days.

## üìå Overview

In urban areas, pricing parking smartly can help manage demand and reduce congestion. This project demonstrates a **real-time dynamic pricing engine** for parking systems using **Pathway**, a powerful stream processing engine.

It features:
- Stream-based data aggregation (occupancy, queue, traffic)
- Three pricing models for flexibility and benchmarking
- Live plotting of model-based prices
- Easy extensibility for deployment or integration

‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Explained
Data Ingestion
Simulated or live parking data is ingested into a Pathway stream (data_with_time). It includes:

SystemCodeNumber, Occupancy, Capacity, QueueLength, TrafficConditionNearby, VehicleType, IsSpecialDay, and timestamp.

Daily Tumbling Window
Using pw.temporal.tumbling(datetime.timedelta(days=1)), we aggregate data by lot and day.

Three Pricing Models

Model 1: Basic occupancy ratio model.

Model 2: Advanced pricing using traffic, vehicle, queue, special events.

Model 3: Captures demand volatility via max-min occupancy spread.

Computed Columns
Intermediate values like average occupancy and queue length are computed for pricing models.

Visualization
A bokeh and panel plot shows Model 1 vs Model 2 vs Model 3 prices over time.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run:

Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/arya892004/summer-analytics-internship.git
cd realtime-parking-pricing

Set up the Python environment:
pip install pathway panel bokeh

Run the notebook:
jupyter notebook

At the end of the notebook, view the real-time pricing plot:

pn.Column(viz).servable()
üìà Output Example
Prices will dynamically range between ‚Çπ10‚Äì‚Çπ15/day depending on occupancy and context.
